# Training a smartcab
This is the 5th project for the Machine Learning Nanodegree Program. This project uses reinforcement learning, especially Q-learning algorithm to an agent to smartly drive a cab in a simulated Grid Road Network with lights and traffic around. The ultimate goal is to teach the agent to drive both safely (try to avoid traffic violations and accidents) and efficiently (try to reach the destination in time).

## Code Usage
- First download the repository to your desktop and unzip it.
- Open the ```report.html``` in your browser, where model development results are showned in a HTML file.
- Alternatively, you can open ```smartcab.ipynb``` in your Jupyter, to re-run the cells (where necessary data and scripts are also included).
